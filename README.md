## Refactor Plan  

A major refactor is underway to improve maintainability, scalability, and performance. Key improvements include:  
- Modular **project structure** with clear separation of concerns  
- Optimized **middleware** for caching, rate limiting, and error handling  
- Enhanced **scraper architecture** with a base scraper class and parallel processing  
- Improved **API design** with versioning and structured responses  
- Comprehensive **testing strategy** (unit & integration tests)  
- Strengthened **security** measures (rate limiting, validation, CORS protection)  

For detailed refactor guidelines, check the [Refactoring Guide](docs/RefactoringGuide.pdf).
